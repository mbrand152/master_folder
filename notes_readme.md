# HTML
It is the skeleton that gives every webpage its structure. Creating a big amount of text which means something that the computer can read. It's basically saying to the computer, "this bit of text, well this is a heading," it shows the meaning of what the thing it. It is just a bunch of boxes around a bunch of text.

# CSS
Stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It arranges the different boxes, and styles the way that the text inside them appears. There is a hierarchy of rules where one may override the others. 



# Javascript
Adds interactive elements onto the webpage, and it can also add security to the webpage because webpages used to be pretty flat and boring. It is an actually programming language. Html basically marks or highlights things in a bit of text, css just styles it, but Javascript uses logical things to tell elements on the page to do something.

AKA Vision Control. Allows space for collaboration where people can add to or alter the original file. Used to be where people would override each others changes, but now, it saves them as multiple files.
